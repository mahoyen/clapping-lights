# Clapping lights

Code for an arduino micro with three lights and a potentiometer to indicate when to clapp for the song ["Clapping Music" by Steve Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapping_Music).

## How it works
- The green light indicates the tempo.
- The potentiometer regulates how fast the tempo is.
- The red and blue lights indicate whether to clap or not at the next green blink.
  - The red light is clapper 1.
  - The blue light is clapper 2.
